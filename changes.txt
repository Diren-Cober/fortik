0.4.0
>	The system rebuild. Just demo.


0.4.1
>	Hotfix: slots in frt_core.stack.Stack class are uncommented.
>	Parser's, compiler's and executor's interfaces changes: 'with_debug' parameter is now false by default.
>	Logic (including debug) for words definition.
>	Stub logic for words execution.
>	Hotfix: stub logic for manual cycle counter manipulation.
>	Debug variation of 'execute' (test version).


0.4.2
>	Improved debug output (mostly execution and mostly words).
>	Improved words logic.


0.4.3
>	Hotfix: additional check if an executed word is derived or builtin (useful in debug mode).
>	Simple REPL.
>	The first part of words' rework.


0.4.4 (a big patch)
>	A rudiment is removed: 'frt_core.state.State' object does not hold current program and instruction index.
>	An optimization in frt_bootstrap.boot_low.get_commas_reducer: redundant function calls replaced with one lambda.
>	A bugfix in main: error messages are generated only on demand, process does not fall on formatting stage.
>	A bugfix in frt_bootstrap.boot_low.check_if_any_system_files_are_missing: recently added files are now checked.
>	An optimization in frt_bootstrap.boot_low.check_if_any_system_files_are_missing: sep_join_arg's __setitem__
..  is now pre-cached, this should cause a small speedup.
>	A bugfix in frt_bootstrap.boot_executor.get_executor.execute_with_debug: already defined words a provided with
..	the same debug message, as recently defined ones; small changes in frt_bootstrap.boot_executor.get_executor.
>	Small changes in frt_core.state.State (mostly about bugs).
>	The second part of words' rework.


0.4.5
>	A rudiment is removed: a 'frt_core.stack.Stack' object has not 'ret_stack' but 'aux_stack' field:
..	this stack is not used in calls, now it is just auxiliary.
>	A rudiment is removed: a 'frt_core.machine.VM' object does not hold recent code and input.
>	'frt_core.settings' module (it has been introduced instead of 'frt_core.debugging' one).
>   Some optimizations in two analogous functions: 'frt_encoding.coder.check_if_any_code_pages_are_missing' and
..  'frt_localization.locale.check_if_any_localizations_are_missing'; the optimizations are similar to ones performed
..  in 'frt_bootstrap.boot_low.check_if_any_system_files_are_missing' function.
