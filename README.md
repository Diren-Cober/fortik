# fortik

Tiny Forth-like language for teaching purposes.

1. Extend it!
2. Rewrite it in your favorite language!

###### UPD (from DC) #

When I forked the original repo, the language was really tiny. However, now it does not seem to be.
I've tried to build a fully functional system supporting forth-like language.
I've also tried to make the system optimal having a StackOverflow, python's docs and CPython's sources.
I am not sure if I've succeeded, but I am sure there is a lot of non-pythonic code you - reading this - may find mad and ugly.
However, it was my own choice. If you decide to make your version of fortik, the choice will be yours.
